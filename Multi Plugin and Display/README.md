# rapidRTOS Example - Multiple plugins and display

This is an example project which controls an SSD1306 display and launches a number of plugins which are stopped and restarted to demonstrate controlling asynchronous tasks imported as rapidPlugins.

rapidRTOS is a framework in which plugins are used to isolate and abstract the use of various sensors and processes to simplify prototyping and save time and effort on projects.

## Usage

Run this example using an SSD1306 display to take full advantage. Make sure to use pins 16/17 for SDA/SCL lines or modify the generated display header file. You can even modify it to use a different display.
